# Inter-Task Similarity and Knowledge Transfer

This repository contains the implementation of the method presented in the article "Inter-task Similarity Measure for Heterogeneous Tasks". The method measures inter-task similarity between RL tasks with discrete state and action spaces and transfers Q-values from one task to the other.
